I am studying the role of fairness in social dilemma as a graduate student at the University of Tokyo. Due to my experiences studying commerce as an undergraduate student at Hitotsubashi University, as well as studying psychology as an exchange student at the University of British Columbia, Canada, I have developed an interest in justice and fairness; game theory and social dilemma; and organizational citizenship behavior.

location: The 9th Asian Conference on Psychology & the Behavioral Sciences (Tokyo, Japan)
summary: Oral presentation
abstract: "Background: The situation where only one volunteer is needed to provide the group benefit is known as the “volunteer’s dilemma” (Diekmann, 1985). If someone volunteers, everyone benefits, but if nobody does, everyone suffers. It is rational to be the only volunteer when nobody else steps forward, and to freeride when others volunteer. Yet, based on studies of justice sensitivity (Schmitt et al., 2010), we hypothesize that people make irrational decisions: When those high in self-oriented justice sensitivity find that nobody is going to volunteer, they will avoid being the only volunteer because it seems unfair. When those high in other-oriented justice sensitivity find that someone is going to volunteer, they will also volunteer so as not to let the other person be the only one who pays for the cost of volunteering. Method: We conducted a vignette experiment (n=97). The participants completed Justice Sensitivity Inventory, and read a vignette about an everyday problem of a volunteer’s dilemma which often happens at a university dorm. They were divided into two conditions: one (out of six) member always volunteers in the vignette vs. nobody volunteers. The participants were asked how likely they would volunteer in the situation. Results: The hypotheses were partly supported; how likely people would volunteer was predicted by other-oriented justice sensitivity (β=.34, p<.01), but not by self-oriented justice sensitivity (β=-.04, n.s.) regardless of the condition. This result suggests that other-oriented justice sensitivity might be a strong predictor of a behavior (i.e., to volunteer or not) in a volunteer’s dilemma."

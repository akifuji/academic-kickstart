abstract: "Handicapped people have faced discriminatory attitudes from the non-handicapped. This often deprives them of fundamental human rights and makes them mentally ill. Symbolic ableism is one of the key forms of discriminatory attitudes toward the handicapped, and this is regarded as a cause of disagreement with the policy of supporting them. The propensity of symbolic ableism can be measured by the Symbolic Ableism Scale (SAS; Friedman & Awsumb, 2019), which divides symbolic ableism into four components: individualism, lack of recognition of continuing discrimination, lack of empathy for disabled people, and excessive demands. Although this scale is necessary for understanding peopleâ€™s attitudes toward the handicapped, it is not available in Japanese. This study was conducted to develop a Japanese version of SAS (SAS-J) and examined its reliability and validity. The result showed that SAS-J was divided into two components (i.e., individualism and lack of recognition of current condition), which is different from the original version. We discussed possible explanations of this difference, the reliability and validity of SAS-J, and future directions of symbolic ableism."

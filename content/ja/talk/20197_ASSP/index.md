abstract: "Background: The situation where only one volunteer is needed to provide the group benefit is known as the “volunteer’s dilemma” (Diekmann, 1985). If someone volunteers, everyone benefits, but if nobody does, everyone suffers. It is rational to be the only volunteer when nobody is likely to step forward, and to freeride when someone else is likely to volunteer. Based on studies of justice sensitivity (e.g., Schmitt et al., 2010), however, we hypothesize that people would make rather irrational decisions: When those high in self-oriented justice sensitivity (sensitivity to becoming a victim of injustice) find that nobody is going to volunteer, they would shirk because it is unfair for them to be the only one who incurs the cost of volunteering. In contrast, when those high in other-oriented justice sensitivity (sensitivity to benefiting from injustice) find that someone else is going to volunteer, they would also volunteer so as not to let the person be the only one who incurs the cost of volunteering. Method: We conducted two scenario-based experiments (Study1: n = 94, Study2: n = 93). The participants completed Justice Sensitivity Inventory (Schmitt et al., 2010), and read a scenario of the volunteer’s dilemma, which is likely to happen at a workplace. They were divided into two conditions: one (out of six) member always volunteers vs. nobody volunteers in the scenario. The participants were asked how likely they would volunteer in the situation. Results: The hypotheses were partly supported in both studies; self-oriented justice sensitivity had the negative effect and other-oriented justice sensitivity had the positive effect on people’s willingness to volunteer; however, it was regardless of condition (i.e., the number of volunteers). The present research contributes to the literature on the associations between justice sensitivity and people’s behavior, specifically prosocial and antisocial behavior, in the volunteer’s dilemma."
